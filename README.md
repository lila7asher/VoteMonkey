# Treeville Elections Advisor


## Description
```
My project is a simple website to help the monkeys of Treeville decide who to vote for in the next Mayoral election. On the home page, there is a quiz, where visitors will select their top concern from a list of issues. They will then be directed to the profiles page, with their candidate of choice highlighted. The full profiles page can also be accessed from a button in the header.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
I have over 2 dozen CSS rules, so I'm not going to explain them all, as some of them are self-explanatory.

A few notable classes are:

1. #headercontent
  This rule targets the headercontent ID and keeps it from getting too wide. It references a div which contains the logo, main heading, and navigation button in the header. The max-width is set to 90%, until the screen size reaches 700px, when the class is targetted again in a media query to make sure the content never exceeds 700px in width. Setting margin: auto makes sure that the div stays centered, and the flexbox properties control the placement of the content inside the div.

2. #issuebox
  This rule targets the issuebox div, which contains the form questions on the home page. The margin, padding, border, and border radius properties ensure that the box has a nice appearance. However, the most important property is the display value of block. When the submit button is clicked, JavaScript switches the display value to none, so that the #suggestion div is displayed instead.

3. section and .bios
  These rules together create the behavior of the Profiles on the profiles page using Flexbox. The .bios class references a container div which holds all three profiles. Its display is set to flex, with a flex-direction of row and flexwrap on, so that the profiles follow horizontally after each other and break to the next line when they are out of room. The rule for the section tag sets a flex-basis of 300px to ensure that the profiles do not get too narrow, and a max-width of 500px so that they do not get too wide. Flexgrow: 1 indicates that they will all grow to take up equal space on the line, and margin: auto centers each profile when it is alone on a line. Back in the .bios class, justify-content: space-around makes sure that each profile is centered and equally spaced when sharing a line.
  
4. section:target
  This rule uses the pseudoclass of :target to add a green border around the profile that is the target of the link on the first page. It is only activated when viewing the profiles page from a link generated by JavaScript after filling out the issue form.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript function I created is:

1. an unnamed function that is triggered by clicking the submit button
  This function displays the content that corresponds to the user's choice from the list of issues. First, it listens for a click on the Submit Button. When the button is clicked, the function checks which of the radio buttons is selected. Each candidate for mayor has one top issue, so for each issue that is selected, the user is directed to a different candidate. The function does this by filling in the span element with the candidate's name, and changing the href attribute on the link to have a different profile as its target. The function also hides the survey box and displays the result box. If a user attempts to click the submit button without selecting an issue, the function displays an alert telling them to please select an issue.
